## Final project for CPSC 210 Software Construction course.

Implemented an Android application to help the user locate bus stops in their vincinity by mapping the location of stops, busses and routes on the Greater Vancouver Transit system. The closest stop to the user is highlighted on the map and its location is displayed on the bottom of the screen. The user can also click on any of the stops to display buses and it their arrival times at that stop. Additionally, it displays the bus routes on the map as different coloured lines.

The application parses JSON data from [Translink Open API ](https://developer.translink.ca/).
