## Final project for CPSC 210 Software Construction course.

Implemented an Android application that maps the location of stops, busses and bus routes on the Greater Vancouver Transit system and retrieves real time arrival information at those stops.  

Additionally, it plots the user's location and map highlights the nearest bus stop.
The application uses [Translink Open API ](https://developer.translink.ca/), free of charge.
